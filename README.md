<h1>Telegram Weather bot made with Aiogram in python</h1>
<h3>This is the first bot I made as I was learning aiogram Library.
It is made for beginners. Nothing much.</h3>

<p>Please obtain your telegram bot API token and put it in config.py This project I used Openweather to grab realtime weather data so you are supposed to get yours.
After grabbing all the token just run bot_weather.py and search the name of your bot on telegram. There you go.!!!</p>
